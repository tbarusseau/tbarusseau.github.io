# Pretty bubbles

Action-RPG games like [Path of Exile][1] or [Diablo][2] usually feature resources for you character, such as life or mana.

On top of being informative at a glance, they can be really pretty:

They usually feature moving textures, for example in Diablo 3:

But... How can I do something similar?

## What we're gonna use

- A Unity project with the built-in renderer
- Some pretty textures
- Shader and mesh magic âœ¨

## What this post won't cover

- Actually drawing a pretty UI around the bubble because I can't draw.
